# !!Wordle Clone!! 

After marveling at Wordle's popularity over the last two months I decided as a new dev to take a stab at it. This recreation is is no way meant to take away from Wordle. Please visit the original [@Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and enjoy. If you do play my version feel free to leave me any tips, or reccomendations for improvements!

## Introduction

This was made in an attempt to mimic the original Wordle as best as possible. I did not in any way use or take any source code from any other simialar projects and all code here is solely my own. Enjoy!

- Localstorage (resets at end of day) for persistance after refresh

```
$ cd ../somegame
$ npm start

```
